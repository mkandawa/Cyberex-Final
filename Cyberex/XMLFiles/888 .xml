      <description><![CDATA[888 is a well run, lean, efficient machine. Unlike BPTY which has lost its way. I think 888 does not need to carry a premium for takeover, its numbers this year should be very good and should see them heading towards 165, some analysts see higher....maybe, maybe not....but 165 is there for the taking]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Good day everyone on this board.  I decided to take a position today on 888.   I see this is not only cheap for now and had some record results but also 888 is going against the general down trend and upward since July..  I also like the fact this is FTSE small-cap rather than AIM so broker analysis can be more trusted.

It has great value across all key metrics, has strong cash flow and as far as I can see strong balance sheet.

      <description><![CDATA[Familyguy, 

I saw you tipping 888 on GC so I've followed you here lol 

The EV/EBIT ratio is okay. TNW is shocking (3% of MC). But it's the thought of this rising cos of the techs that has got my imagination going - how do you know this'll rise? and what do you reckon it'll rise to?

Additionally will the nevada license for poker sites be that much of a game changer considering the huge level of competition in the state / Las Vegas? 

Best regards, 

Dan]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I think it will turn for the better very soon on the run up to the first-half results on the 27th Aug. The Amaya deal is still holding back the share price plus sector in general hasn't been too pleasant. I'm looking to hopefully buy in at around 110-113.]]></description>

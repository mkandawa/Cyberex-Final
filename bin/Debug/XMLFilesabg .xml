      <title>[sinnerthesaint] Lawyers seeks Barrick's help</title>
      <author>sinnerthesaint</author>
      <description><![CDATA[A group of Tanzanian villagers who are suing African Barrick Gold (LON:ABG) in a U.K. court, alleging the miner was complicit in the killing of six locals by police, have asked parent-company Barrick (NYSE, TSX:ABX) to &#8220;live up to their corporate responsibility and human rights commitments.&#8221;

In an e-mailed statement, London-based law firm Leigh Day&#8217;s partner, Shanta Martin, who is representing the Tanzanian claimants, said that impoverished people who dare to sue multinationals often face incredible obstacles to having their claims heard by an independent arbiter.

The lawyer, who is in Ottawa this week, said that on Nov. 19 his clients will seek orders from the English court requiring African Barrick to hand over internal documents considered &quot;key&quot; and take other steps to get the case to trial.

&#8220;Barrick Gold Corporation says it respects human rights wherever it does business and recognizes the dignity of the people they interact with every day,&#8221; the statement says.

But it adds that at the North Mara operations of Barrick's majority-owned subsidiary, poverty-stricken locals tempted onto the mine to scratch out rocks for tiny amounts of gold are &#8220;regularly being shot at with live ammunition.&#8221;

      <title>[GlenFidrich] RE: Questor</title>
      <author>GlenFidrich</author>
      <description><![CDATA[If Questor is saying 'avoid', then that is a definite 'buy' for me! Just do a little research. In January 2013, Questor recommended ABG as a buy at @ 3 pounds 50p. By July 2013, ABG's SP was @ 1 pound (I know, I bought in). Then in Jan 2014, Questor recommended selling ABG @ 2 pounds a share. The share went on to a high of 3 pounds 20p in March, before falling back to current levels. So, obviously, if you had heeded Questor's advice, you would be seriously out of pocket. But yeah, avoid it now, at your peril!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[

Avoid African Barrick Gold until recovery takes root: Shares in African Barrick Gold rose 4.7% to 214.4p after brokers made reassuring noises about the miner&#8217;s ability to turn round its struggling mines. The miner&#8217;s third quarter results, which came out on October 23, showed signs of improvement. Gold production increased to about 190,986 ounces in the three months ended September - up 16% on the same period last year. The company also cut the costs of production by 13% on the same stage last year, to $1,098 per ounce. African Barrick said third quarter revenue was up 9% to $241 million, as the increased output more than offset lower gold prices. The cash position is also improving marginally, with total cash up $17 million to $287 million at September 30, leaving an estimate for net cash of $145 million once the $142 million loan facility is subtracted. The company had cash of $401 million at the end of June last year. However, Questor would still be reluctant to jump back into this high-cost gold miner. The market expects pretax profits of $149.4 million this year on revenue of $931.1 million, giving earnings per share of 25.2c (15.6p). African Barrick is a higher cost operator and, given the weaker prices in nearly all commodities this year, it is at risk from gold falling lower. African Barrick Gold at 214.4p+9.4p Questor Says &#8216;Avoid&#8217;

      <title>[sinnerthesaint] Commendation from Minister of State</title>
      <author>sinnerthesaint</author>
      <description><![CDATA[Tarime &#8212; MINISTER of State in the Vice-President's Office ( Environment) Dr Binilith Mahenge, has commended North Mara Gold Mine for conforming to the highest environmental protection standards.

&quot;I am impressed to see that North Mara Gold Mine has heavily invested in environmental programmes and I believe other mines will take a leaf,&quot; Dr Mahenge said here over the weekend after spending several hours inspecting various environmental programmes by the mine.

Among other things, he was shown a Tailings Storage Facility (TSF), a modern multimillion shilling water treatment plant which recycles waste water.

A few years back the mine was in the spotlight after allegedly polluting River Tigithe, one of the major sources of water for the surrounding villages.

The mine was now spending 1.5 million US dollars (over 2.5bn/-) on environmental programmes each year, according to its General Manager, Mr Gary Chapman. Dr Mahenge said the government needed investments that strictly adhered to acceptable environmental standards.



He was accompanied by several senior officials from the National Environment Management Council (NEMC), including Dr Robert Ntakamulenga, the Director of Compliance and Enforcement at NECM, and Mr Manchare Heche, a senior legal officer from NEMC.

The minister was shown two modern public primary schools which had been built with support from the mine at a cost of over 3bn/-. He also called on the mine to support artisanal miners living in the villages around the mine.

Dr Mahenge also witnessed dozens of youth who intruded in one of the gold mine's pits to steal gold sand at high risk to the environment. The intruders were armed with sharp objects which appeared to be machetes.

Frequent intrusions by mostly young men have continued to be one of the critical problems disturbing operations at the mine, which is operated by African Barrick Gold (ABG).

      <description><![CDATA[of course there's maipulations every day late at night,well documented,and very successful it has been this year.The HUI goldmining index was 199 yesterday compared to a many years low of 190 last year..I've posted a lot elsewhere that miners can't produce at a certain level at all as it is too close to their all in costs.Yes these might be further reduced as they've been already by most companies.However you can't go to the well too often.At that point supply will dry up.Then the gold market must turn.And no large miners have burst for years,producers have ways of re jigging finance and even shorting gold if need be.I'd guess a few might be starved out by a huge gold price drop but not before that supply automatic price adjuster which might be getting near at least with silver soon,and possibly gold too.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I know rbrand quite well but not the others.As an ABG holder I see a typical large producer.I've quite a lot in here.I don't post much here though.As to long term holding see how in successful companies the directors act.Not for them much buying or selling.Yes they might be hedging of course.I'd also guess they'd have several quite large gold company holdings and might be directors somewhere else too.Rules make it harder to jig about in any case then there's dealing costs.If you did sell here a large holding you'd be saying mining in general is very bad.Otherwise why just sell here ? Then where next ? The general shares markets,or in cash at 0% or rocky bonds ?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Yes agree with u. I have become,strict on monetary risk. Weekly or,daily, stop will represent same money. A comfortable loss, if you will. I do check daily periodically. Eg, if weekly signals long, bit a resistance price level right above current price.....Il wait for a daily close,above that the following week, to enter. Does not risk more. Same risk. Adjust position size. But gives slightly higher probability. However, after entering on daily close, will follow weekly thereafter, as it's,where signal was called.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Of you mean, the cost of mining gold? And how spot price could drop below it? Well, as said below, spot price manipulation could go on forever. Americans trying to manipulate spot, to offset Chinese debt etc. I don't understand it. I just read about it. However, assume no manipulation. Well, big gold miners sell gold at SP,  up to 12 months in advance. So a drop below 1200, they can take that. Just not sell more till above cost again. 1200 region on spot price, will bring in buyers for a bounce, both in gold and miners. But imo on weekly chart, it's,a short. And will stay that,way, until chart says it's a long from a,support lol. I'm holding short, this and randgold. Until spot gold gives clarity around 1200. If drops below it, I expect this to tank. If not, happy days for bulls on them]]></description>

      <author>sinnerthesaint</author>
      <description><![CDATA[&quot;I think it's all about the timeframe / timespans you trade&quot;

Joeysheedy, I agree that the factor above has strong relevance. When I said you have to be in the market all the time, I was indeed referring to daytrading and I meant trading not price-watching - but most importantly I was referring to the casino-house principles. If you are just price watching then yes, what's the point, you might as well be having a game of tennis - it can even be counter productive as you have found out the hard way. Analysis-&gt;Strategy-&gt;Plan-&gt;Execute and repeat - That should take all the time you have in a trading-day, no time for watching prices and getting psychological side-effects. Volume of trading is important because daily volatility only gives you tight margins when compared to weeklies and monthlies and you don't want to throw all your eggs in one basket either. Of course, I'm talking about your own tried and tested strategies here, you cannot wedge your experimental ones in here otherwise you'd just be feeding those on commissions. All the best.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[you talk sense and much to be said for that approach. I had  Pog and spent hours each week looking at the voluminous comments, nearly drove me mad ! also had ABG for couple of years and largely ignore it. Currently down of course but I did make a good quick profit in my Isa when the share was much lower than now -so being a gold believer , I don`t feel too bad.With the huge bubble in US, not sure about opportunity cost now?
 One thing puzzles me. On next page someone posted an  piece by a firm I never heard of; nice and optomistic BUT saying all in costs about $1200 and since the gold sp is little more, I don`t quite get his optimism; do you?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[I think it's all about the timeframe / timespans you trade. In my first years, I was on top of the market morning and night etc. But for some reason, watching the markets made me change my mind too often, to my accounts demise. So I changed strategy. Decided I would review each financial instrument one a weekend. Go with weekly charts and not watch markets daily, but do as you said, on a weekly basis. Have to say, it completely reversed my fortunes. Never looked back. So, imo, your psychology probably determines best method. Mine works for me. Yours works for you. So many different ways to view,and enter market successfully. For me, this takes away daily emotion. Analyse, spot entry and target, select best value stop position, and let market crack on. If your method is not working, sometimes you don't need to change it. You might just need to find timeframe that suits personality. Eg for me, watching a market can make me change mind. I eliminated that, kept methodology and risk management same, and as they say, the rest is history.]]></description>

      <title>[joeysheedy] to all</title>
      <author>joeysheedy</author>
      <description><![CDATA[Having read the responses, I can see that this thread, dies indeed, contain intelligent people. Not so on many.others, hence the brush. Great posts by you all. With regards to trading and investing, long or short, I don't see much difference these days. I come from a very deep and long background in the trading world. So, Il give you my insight, because as one pointed out' it is not possible be right all the time. It is simply money management. Fact is, I carved out a great career, only being right probably 50% of the time. Risk management and objectivity were my skills rather than being a master of fundamentals. Hands up, I was never any good at getting right, how the market would interpret it. I could rationalise the data, but never know if the market would be rational. So, why did I get into technical analysis? Irrational market. Yes. But most importantly, by the time we get data releases and news alerts, it's effectively ten years old ' in market time's. It's long traded, even though we think.it's breaking. Solid my view, to get an edge, I realised that if institutions trade all this first, it will be reflected in price. So, in price,  I.learned to see how the makers were interpreting fundamentals. With regards to long term investing, bears are same as bulls. Eg I have held short positions for up to two years, but also true, for only a week.tesco is example. Since 2010, it's been a bear market. To get back to those heights of 2010, could take ten years, if ever. So, I'm simply suggesting through my own experience (career profits to date, 72% from long term short positions), that one should look to the market both ways. Not just profit from value but, but also profit on way to it. However, different strokes for different folks. I'm sure many.of you are successful with longs alone.but with a share such as ABG, at least wait till price shows its value (institutions). If u do that, at 200p, you could already be 100% up in it, in the future.]]></description>

      <author>sinnerthesaint</author>
      <description><![CDATA[&quot;It is also possible, I understand, to take a long term approach with trading 'tools' &quot;

I'm sure there's a lot of material on the internet and in books which can give you a better insight with the above. However, fwiw, from my experience, you need different mindset for 'trading' and 'investing long term'. 

For investing long term, you need the 'one' strategy. Once you know the strategy you want to use, all your work then goes into the research, analysis, risk management and decisions to feed your one strategy. And this is proven to work in big corporates as well as patient and diligent investors - I've done well with that too.

There is no real need for technical tools but it can give you an insight into how the stock price behaved in history [so your observations in the chart will all be in hindsight] - In this way you can monitor your stock price is behaving 'rationally' during the term you hold it. In my own experience, I believe that you shouldn't use it to make long term decisions however.

When you are trading short term, you cannot just develop one strategy and use it your whole life. You have to regularly come up with new ones all the time. By the time the strategy is popularly known in the market, it is time to use a different one. You use the same technical tools but for different reasons. One common mistakes that new traders do, is they try to make money by predicting future share price using TA. It cannot do that despite the many youtube videos claiming otherwise and some 'traders' on these boards - no matter what the chart 'tells' you, the price can go down or up, there's no certainty. You have to use it in a way so that it gives you a higher probability of making good bets in your long or short positions in the long run and minimise the money lost when your bets turn out to be bad ... as part of a strategy where you have risk and money management. So in effect you are creating your own casino house in the market where the odds of you winning is at least 51 to 49%. So in this way making 49 bad calls is not a problem. One thing, I will add is that you cannot be a part time trader ... you have to be active from the moment the market open and then after it closes you plan your trades for the next day, otherwise it just becomes an expensive 'lessons learnt' session.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Thank you - I must also agree with what you have said although I can't really comment on the TA stuff.  While I have acquainted myself with technical analysis (you would be foolish not too given the number of success stories built off of it), I am not an expert and do not feel my knowledge is there yet to really give it a go.  It is also possible, I understand, to take a long term approach with trading 'tools' and this is something that I shall be attempting with a small account set aside for the experiment at some point.  The short term approach just does not sit with my lifestyle or my personality - to be honest with you I consider 5 years fairly short term!  Its all subjective.

I am delighted to hear of acceptance for pluralism in the market place!  Not only is there room for many views but there is a necessity for them!  Failure and success guide us together and together we will discover how capital can be allocated efficiently to create real value.  Nature did not get humanity right first time, still hasn't really, yet trial and error have found the solutions that insight could not.  Amazing stuff, progress.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Haha, there's always someone long and someone short, although I agree with you that positive opinions on PM stocks, ABG inclusive, and PMs in general are few and far between currently.  This, combined with the absolute thrashing over the last 3 years,  leads me to believe that sentiment is low in this sector.

As Baron 'real investor' Rothschild said: 'Buy when there's blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own.'  Well, we had a flood of blood last summer and perhaps there's another wave to come, who knows.  The fact remains that prices are low in this sector and many fortunes have been made buying low and selling high.  

I must admit to one thing causing me concern with African stocks of any kind currently though - Ebola.  While it has not been seen over ABG's way.

Potentially 1.4 million cases by January...this is, of course, a little sensationalist but if anything like that were to happen and begin to spread towards Tanzania I would be inclined to sell.  The epidemic is already creating localised panic on the continent and we all know how twitchy and nervous markets can be.  I sincerely hope that a solution is found for all of those suffering, the whole situation just sounds awful.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Very good post Beej248, thank-you. I'm not participating in the argument itself, as I realise where both of you are coming from and I accept the market has bandwidth for both and many more mentalities to co-exist. But I thought I'd commend your post as I enjoyed its eloquence, class, the gentlemanly attitude and most importantly (through my perception) the time you took to explain the point in a way that it can help others, especially the young (perhaps inexperienced) ones. 

Good luck to all of you. FWIW I actually agree with both in that in terms of long term investing, while gold is weak an entry between 160 and 270 in ABG is good enough and I believe that in the long term (5-6 years) you could make 200 to 300% with this while you have a good family life without stress as long as ABG keeps cost down and avoid legal issues. For the adrenaline junkies, I would say stay out of shorts, yes its in a triangle and there's a possibility that this goes down further but its starting to rev up some momentum, some indicators shows ABG as oversold and while the moving averages appears to point to a downward direction in the short to medium term, they have converged and reconverged three times - it seems traders in the market cannot decide what they want to do with it. So shorting this right now could get your fingers burnt badly if you are not careful. I won't be trying to teach grandma's how to suck eggs though ... they are just my opinion. Good Luck All.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[What's the rush?!...  Dangerous to think you'll always be right, which is required for the strategy you suggest.  My strategy is very simple (and there's no shame to admit that) - to simply acquire a diversified portfolio of real assets for as low a price as possible.  Always in, initially, with a small percentage of the position I might eventually hold and with every position making up a small portion of the total portfolio.  I have considered gold.  I have considered the rest of the market.  I have considered cash, bonds and real estate.  My honest answer, and we must be honest, is that I don't really know - I don't think anyone does.  I do know, however, that at the current share price here, I can buy these assets at a discount.

My goal is not to obtain the maximum return or to minimise opportunity costs as yours is.  With regards to investment it is to build, over time, a portfolio of investments that one day (I certainly hope) will be realised for a sum that I can live off for retirement.  Its working well so far by the way and has worked very well for many, many thousands in the past.

Now my real goals...these are something else entirely, for what do we really value in this life after all?  Capital appreciation?  Opportunity costs avoided?  Perfect market timing?  Personally, I value my family, my friends, my good health and happiness far more than any of the above and accordingly, I shall 'invest' most of my time there.  Don't forget...opportunity costs are not only financial.

The definition of a 'real' investor, for the record, is one who commits capital with the hope of financial gain in the future.  Interpret that how you will but if you are honest with yourself you will see that it is a pluralistic definition with many possible embodiments.  As with everything else there are many paths to the destination and we must consider and respect others lest we fall victim to the inevitably myopic nature of our own.  I wish you the best of luck anyway, I hope you continue to be right and become enormously wealthy.  Have a good evening for now!]]></description>

'omg I'm going to dump monry into this, don't care if gold and share plummets. Bargain hahaha. Why don't u look at gold etc. Maybe if you wait, your money might return you 120% one day, instead of 20% minus 50% opp cost lol hahaha]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Meaning, while your long and watch it drop, my capital we be compounding elsewhere. Then when.it's made enough, Il come in long here, when the profit will take 3 months instead of 7 years hahaha

So: investment math
Let's say you get a return of 20% in two years on the share. We you've done no better than the next guy, but: you will have to deduct 'missed opportunity cost' from your profit, whilst the real investor, will be adding the 'taken opp profit' to his. Not so smart after all. Fools in many guises]]></description>

Because  that capital could have been 'making money' in the meantime, either short, or elsewhere. I won't say any fool could see that, given its investment mathematics. But pretty.obvious all the same]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[This is so ridiculously cheap...net assets of 1.9 billion vs m cap of 880 million.  Cash/cash convertibles at ~500 million.  That's what you call buying a dollar for 50 cents, what Mr Graham called a margin of safety.  Totally into this (and a number of other mining stocks to be honest) - I don't care if the gold price plummets and the share price with it...I'll just buy more!  This company could be forced to liquidate and you'd still have a chance of getting your money back.  Market timing never was my thing anyway...but bargains...any old fool can spot a bargain with a bit of patience.  Good luck everyone!]]></description>

To explain why people are still short even though price went to 100. Retail investors are mostly long. The institutions,steadied price,at 100. Gave the retailers confidence, and they are now the reason price went to around 300. But the big guns,are holding short. Don't forget, they move the market. They are the ones short from 500, and then let retail take it down. So, how do they make money? Let retail take it long to whatever figure Eg 300. Now the institutions come in to squeeze them out again. Take that money, and let the retail, bring it back to 100 again. But who knows? Maybe big guns,will play same game from 200? I don't know.

So, I'd certainly exit a long if I was bullish, under 200. But I don't mind if your right at this price. If the candles go positive for. Swing here, long too]]></description>

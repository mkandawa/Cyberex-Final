      <description><![CDATA[
Yes been in here a good long while also hold SST  
Must say these stocks have treated me very well indeed.
There can be a bit of temporary volatility but the upward trend comes good again.
These Asian smaller companies trusts are tremendous medium term investments in my view.

      <title>[Mnemosyne] Drop</title>
      <author>Mnemosyne</author>
      <description><![CDATA[AAS is one of the ways I looked to balance my portfolio with some exposure to the Far East.  It has done very nicely indeed for me over the last few months, and the sudden drop is a surprise.  Bet it's a surprise for Mrs Gilbert too, who has lost about &#163;4.5k overnight on her 10,000 buy yesterday!  Anyone else in here?]]></description>

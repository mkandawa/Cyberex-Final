      <description><![CDATA[
Positive Points:
Anglo American saw production had increased across all its major operations in its first quarter, bar platinum.
The company's Chief Executive Mark Cutifani, who took over last April, is seeking to boost profitability by improving operational performance at its mines, slashing costs, reducing the company's project pipeline, and extracting more value from the sale of its products.
Production at De Beers, a diamond producer owned by Anglo, rose 18% to 7.5 million carats in the quarter.
Speculation regarding a potential takeover has previously been rumoured.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[
Negative Points:
The platinum industry in South Africa has been significantly affected by ongoing industrial action and strikes as miners aim to achieve better wages, leading Anglo American to revise down its 2014 platinum production guidance.
Industry-wide cost pressures remain a concern.
Industry-specific risks include government actions, such as controls on imports, exports and prices. Also, new forms or rates of taxation and royalties, and increased government regulation overshadow]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Financial Highlights:
Exploration expenditure in the quarter was $35 million, a decrease of $13 million, spread across all commodities but particularly metallurgical coal and diamonds.
Evaluation expenditure in the period was $47 million, a decrease of 15%. Evaluation expenditure in Q1 2014 was primarily focused on its Copper business.

      <description><![CDATA[First quarter production report: Global diversified miner, Anglo American reported higher output in the first quarter across its major operations when compared with the same quarter a year earlier, with the exception of platinum which suffered from protracted strikes in South Africa. The miner said its iron ore production increased 10% to 11.3 million tonnes for the three months ended 31 March, from 10.3 million tonnes in the previous year. The company reported its export metallurgical coal production increased 31% to 6.1 million tonnes from 4.6 million tonnes, and its export thermal coal production increased by 6% to 4.1 million tonnes. Copper production increased by 18% to 202,000 tonnes, while nickel production increased by 48% to 9,200 tonnes from 6,200 tonnes driven by improved operational stability at its Barro Alto site in Brazil. The company added that its diamond production increased by 18% to 7.5 million carats from 6.4 million carats due to the impact of planned maintenance at its Orapa site in Botswana during the corresponding quarter and recovery of certain operations at its Jwaneng site. Less positively, the miner saw its platinum equivalent refined production decrease by 39% to 357,000 ounces from 583,000 ounces, as a result of ongoing industrial action at its Rustenburg, Amandelbult and Union mines in South Africa. As a result, the group has revised down its 2014 platinum equivalent refined production guidance to roughly 2.1 million ounces, from its previous guidance of 2.3 to 2.4 million ounces]]></description>

      <title>[Mulder] Ridiculous price</title>
      <author>Mulder</author>
      <description><![CDATA[A little over 18 months ago this share was at &#163;26. It has more than halved! I appreciate precious metal prices have fallen but surely this fall is ludicrous and for such a well diversified miner? I also calculate they have the least net debt among the major miners at  around 10%, cash &gt;$8Bn and with assets of over $80Bn even with the Minas Rio writedown. Average revenue ~ $30Bn/year. So can anyone please tell me why this has tanked so much?? The market clearly unfairly hates this share.]]></description>

Positive Points:
Record quarterly copper production of 207,300 tonnes was reported, an increase of 32% and driven by improved operating performance and grades at its Los Bronces and Collahuasi operations.
Nickel production increased by 7% to 9,600 tonnes. Metallurgical coal production increased by 9%.
A number of self-help initiatives and improved financial targets have been outlined by the new Chief Executive. A review of the group&#8217;s business portfolio remains ongoing.
Adjustments were made under the previous CEO including the August 2012 acquisition of a 40% shareholding in De Beers and the sale of a 25.4% shareholding in Anglo American Sur to a Codelco.
The interim dividend payment was maintained at 32 US cents per share.
Foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in relation to the South African Rand and the US dollar, have worked in the group's favour.
Speculation regarding a potential takeover has previously been rumoured.
China remains the world&#8217;s biggest consumer of commodities. The world's second-largest economy grew by 7.8% in the third quarter of 2013 from a year earlier. The latest expansion was the strongest since the 7.9% growth reported for the fourth quarter of 2012.]]></description>

Negative Points:
Iron Ore production fell by 24%. Production at its Sishen mine was impacted by ongoing pit constraints and safety stoppages.
Thermal coal production in South Africa decreased by 1%.
As of its half year results, underlying or adjusted operating profit fell by 15% to $3.3 billion. Unadjusted profit for the half year attributable to equity shareholders declined by 68%. Business returns - attributable Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) &#8211; declined from 14% in H1 2012 to 11% in H1 2013.
Group labour relations remained strained.
Write-downs or impairments against the value of previous investments were taken as of the group&#8217;s 2012 full year results. A $4 billion post-tax impairment was taken against its Minas-Rio iron-ore project in Brazil, with expenditure on the project continuing to rise. A $0.6 billion post tax impairment was also taken against platinum projects.
Given broad uncertainty over the outlook for the global economy, commodity prices remain volatile. For the first nine months of the year, the Chinese economy grew by 7.7%, keeping it on track to achieve the government's growth target of 7.5% this year, but still the worst performance for China in 23 years.
Industry-wide cost pressures remain a concern.
Industry-specific risks include government actions, such as controls on imports, exports and prices. Also, new forms or rates of taxation and royalties, and increased government regulation overshadow.]]></description>

Third quarter production update: The miner reported mixed production output, with the share price falling by over 3% in early stockmarket trading. Iron Ore production fell by 24%. Production at its Sishen mine was impacted by ongoing pit constraints and safety stoppages. However, a plan to address the current pit constraints and a longer term operational strategy is expected to be presented by the end of the year. Export sales volumes decreased by 5%. 

More positively, record quarterly copper production of 207,300 tonnes was reported, an increase of 32% and driven by improved operating performance and grades at its Los Bronces and Collahuasi operations. 

In all, despite ongoing operational issues and uncertainty over global economic health, the relatively new CEO has announced initiatives to improve performance, ]]></description>
